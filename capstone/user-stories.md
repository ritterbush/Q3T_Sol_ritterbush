## Nonprofit

A nonprofit is seeking donations for a project. The project organizer fills out a form with the organization's name, registration number, website, history, and mission.

They are looking forward to benefiting from the Solana community and contributing to their mission.

The platform supervisor gets in contact with the nonprofit and talks about goals and refines the project's messaging. A fundraising goal is determined. A deadline is determined for the project to raise its funds. A percentage fee is agreed on for using the platform. The organization can have the option of changing their address (see 2, below).

The organization is instructed on how to make a wallet keypair. The platform makes a contract with a vault for donations. The project is marketed on the web platform and to those who would benefit to the project and other potential donators.

1. When the deadline is reached, the fee is sent to the project organizer. The remaining funds are sent to the organization and the vault is closed.

2. The organization has lost its keys. Fortunately it allowed the address to be changed. The platform supervisor changes the target address to a new one that the organization generates. The next steps are as in 1, above.

## Scammer

A scammer is looking for easy money. They apply to the platform as a nonprofit organization.

1. The nonprofit named is found to be not registered. The scammer is emailed and they say they are working on it. We tell them we don't work with non registered nonprofits.

2. The nonprofit named is found to be registered. Looking at the details of the organization and references reveals that it is lacking details about its mission and/or oversight and receipts for what it has been doing. We tell them their organization is not marketable and/or lacks demonstration of using funds well in the past.
